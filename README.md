# Vue Translations

## Proof of concept



Having a consistent, reliable and user friendly translation system in our applications is a must, so I started to look for alternatives in order to replace the current vue-based translation system that we're using at my job for something more updated and common among vue.js applications.


The proof of concept is mostly based on [this](https://medium.com/better-programming/vue-i18n-ultimate-guide-fb3d9db48c94) article I found surfing the internet.

It's quite simple and easy to follow.

The packages required to make the magic are:



```console
vue-i18n
vue-translation-manager
```


And also an application called babel edit that makes managing our translations easy which is available on windows, linux and mac os.

vscode's i18n-ally extension is a helpful tool as well to visualize the current translations in our vue templates so using it is a good idea.
