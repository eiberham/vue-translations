---

The primary way to use `vue-translation-manager` is over the CLI. To install it, choose and follow one of the following steps.

## Global installation

Install `vue-translation-manager` globally to use it in every project you want without having to install it locally.

```
npm i -g vue-translation-manager
```

## Using npx

[npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) is a command line tool brought to you by the npm team and is being shipped
with `npm@>=6.0.0`. It uses locally installed dependencies or downloads the required packages on the go.

## Local installation

If you use the library just with one specific project, it is recommendable to install it for this project locally:

```
npm install vue-translation-manager --save
```

You then can run it either using [npx](#Using_npx) or like this:

```
node_modules/.bin/vue-translation-manager --help
```
