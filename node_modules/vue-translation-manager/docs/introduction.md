# Introduction

Developing a fully internationalized application (in Vue) can be hard. The `vue-translation-manager` strives to make
things a bit easier by giving you a tool to manage your translations.

It can be used with existing libraries like [`vue-i18n`](https://npm.im/vue-i18n) or [`vuex-i18n`](https://npm.im/vuex-i18n).

There is an interactive way where we automatically detect untranslated strings in your Vue
components or you can just use the commands to quickly add, edit or delete translation strings.

The adapter model we chose allows for managing your translations in whatever file format you like.
Developing new adapters is quite straight-forward if there is none already that fulfills your
needs.
